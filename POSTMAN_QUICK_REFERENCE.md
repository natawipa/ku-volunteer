3. **Organizer approves pending application**

   - Same organization as activity

4. **Organizer rejects with valid reason**
   - Reason: 1-225 characters
   - Same organization as activity

### ‚ùå Should Fail

1. **Student applies twice**

   ```
   Expected: 400 - "You have already applied to this activity."
   ```

2. **Student applies to closed activity**

   ```
   Expected: 400 - "This activity is not open for applications."
   ```

3. **Student applies to full activity**

   ```
   Expected: 400 - "This activity has reached maximum capacity."
   ```

4. **Organizer rejects without reason**

   }
   Expected: 400 - "Rejection reason is required"
   ```

5. **Organizer rejects with reason > 225 chars**

| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| `baseUrl`           | `http://localhost:8000` | Base API URL         |

## üéØ Auto-Save Token Script

Add this to the **Tests** tab of your login requests:

```javascript
if (pm.response.code === 200) {
  const jsonData = pm.response.json();
  pm.collectionVariables.set("token", jsonData.access);
  console.log("‚úÖ Token saved!");
}
```

Then use `{{token}}` in your Authorization headers.

## üêõ Common Issues

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized

- **Check:** Token is set in Authorization header
- **Fix:** Login again and save new token

### Issue: 403 Forbidden

- **Check:** Using correct role (student vs organizer)
- **Fix:** Login with appropriate account

### Issue: 400 "Activity is not open"

- **Check:** Activity status in database
- **Fix:** Update activity status to "open"

### Issue: Empty response on list

- **Check:** User has applications or permissions
- **Fix:** Create test application first

## üí° Tips

1. **Use Environments** for different servers (dev/staging/prod)
2. **Save tokens as variables** to avoid copy-paste
3. **Create test data** before running tests
4. **Use pre-request scripts** to setup test conditions
5. **Chain requests** using variables from previous responses
